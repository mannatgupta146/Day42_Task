# Day 42 Task | Cohort 2.0

This file contains all the **JavaScript exercises and experiments** I completed as part of **Day 41**.  
It focuses on **higher-order functions**, **pure and impure functions**, **object destructuring**, **array methods**, and **object behavior with freeze and seal**.

📌 **About the Day 41 Task**  
Day 41 was centered around learning and practicing **functional thinking**, **logic building**, and **intermediate JavaScript concepts** like higher-order functions, functional purity, destructuring, and ES6 array methods.

✨ **Task Description**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Higher-Order Functions | Executed a function multiple times inside another function. |
| Pure vs Impure Functions | Understood predictable output vs side-effect based functions. |
| Object Destructuring | Extracted properties directly inside function parameters. |
| Normal vs Arrow Functions | Observed how `this` behaves differently in both cases. |
| map() | Created a new array of squared values. |
| filter() | Extracted even numbers from an array. |
| some() and every() | Tested conditions on an array of strings. |
| Object.freeze() and Object.seal() | Checked how objects behave when changes are restricted. |
| Nested Objects | Accessed deeply nested properties. |

🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- VS Code / Browser Console  
- Node.js (optional)

## 🧩 Practice Questions – Level 2 (Functional Thinking and Logic)

### 1. Higher-order function  
Created `runTwice(fn)` to execute a function two times.

### 2. Pure and Impure functions  
A pure function that always returns the same output for the same input, and an impure function using a global variable.

### 3. Object destructuring inside parameters  
Extracted `name` and `age` directly inside function arguments.

### 4. Normal vs Arrow function behavior  
Demonstrated how `this` changes inside normal functions but not in arrow functions used as object methods.

### 5. Using map()  
Generated a new array where each number was squared.

### 6. Using filter()  
Filtered and returned only even numbers from an array.

### 7. Using some()  
Checked if at least one name is longer than 3 characters.

### 8. Using every()  
Checked if all names are longer than 3 characters.

### 9. Object.freeze() and Object.seal()  
Observed how sealed and frozen objects restrict modifications.

### 10. Accessing nested objects  
Accessed the `city` value from a nested object.

## 📖 Learning Outcome  
Through this task, I learned how to:

- Use **higher-order functions** to run logic multiple times  
- Understand the difference between **pure** and **impure** functions  
- Use **object destructuring** inside parameters  
- Work with powerful array methods like **map**, **filter**, **some**, and **every**  
- Understand how **this** behaves differently in normal vs arrow functions  
- See how JavaScript objects behave with **seal** and **freeze**  
- Access values inside **nested objects**  

These exercises increased my understanding of **functional programming**, **immutability**, and **modern ES6 concepts**.

## 🌟 Acknowledgement  
This task helped me improve my **JavaScript logic, functional thinking, and ES6 concepts**.  
I am grateful for the consistent guidance and support that helps me learn and grow every day.
